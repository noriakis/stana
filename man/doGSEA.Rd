doGSEA(
  stana,

\arguments{
\item{stana}{stana object}

\item{candSp}{candidate species}

\item{cl}{if NULL, grouping in stana is used}

\item{eps}{pseudovalue added if log is taken}

\item{how}{how to combine multiple variables, default to mean}

\item{zeroPerc}{genes >= the percentage of count zero sample will be excluded.
Default to zero, not recommended in GSEA}

\item{rankMethod}{how to rank genes}

\item{target}{pathway or module}

\item{bg_filter}{filter the background for those in table}
}
\value{
GSEA results from clusterProfiler
}
\description{
Based on KEGG database, GSEA will be performed by the function.
clusterProfiler::GSEA is used.
By default this uses moderated t-statistics for ranking of the genes.
